(2016) with mantle flow experiments to model the evolving mantle structure for the post-Pangea timeframe. In addition to incorporating relative motion between plates, the tectonic reconstructions presented here use a hybrid absolute reference frame based on a moving hotspot model from Torsvik et al. (2008) from 0–70 Ma, and a true polar wander corrected paleomagnetic model from Steinberger & Torsvik (2008) for older times, allowing for a 35 Myr transition period (70–105 Ma) from one reference frame to the other (Müller et al., 2016). A key feature of these plate reconstructions is the algorithm that generates time-evolving and topologically-closed plate polygons (Gurnis et al., 2012). These global plate topologies were used to sample the plate velocity field, which was imposed on the surface of the global mantle flow experiments (Gurnis et al., 2012)."},

In this setting, lithospheric thinning can be extreme and localized, leading to very deep basins and thick accumulation of sediments. We hypothesise that the redistribution of surface load from source-to-sink modulates the stress field in the upper crust where faults and fractures initiate and control the architecture of sedimentary basins. In this suite of experiments, we compare the same experiment with and without surface processes, and we consider a variety of scenario varying sea-level (-200m, -500m, -800m with respect to the position of the surface of the crust), and the rheology of the lithosphere. The dimension of the model is 384x256x128 km. It includes 8 km of air-like material, 40 km of crust (upper crust is in blue, lower crust in orange), 60 km of lithospheric mantle (green), and 20 km of asthenosphere (blue). Two vertical and parallel master faults are embedded into the lithosphere in the form of two pre-damaged prism with dimension 192x25x95 km, extending from 5 km below the surface of the crust down to base of the lithosphere. The damage inside these prisms follows a gaussian with peak damage in the center of the prism along the X and Y axes. These two faults are non-overlapping. Their walls and tips are separated by a gap of 48 km and 0 km respectively (see Figure above). A kinematic boundary condition designed to promote transcurrent tectonics is imposed on the two vertical walls normal to the X direction. The velocity component along X is ±1.92 cm/yr (see Figure), and we impose a velocity component along Z of 0.025 cm/yr to prevent rivers to fall off the grid. A free slip condition is attached to the base of the model and to the two vertical walls parallel to the direction of motion. A pseudo-isostatic boundary condition is imposed at the base of the model. Models are run for 10 myr. We have run this experiment using three numerical framework: Underworld 1.8, Underworld Geodynamics, and Badlands-Underworld Geodynamics. The Underworld 1.8 outputs were used to extract the velocity field close to the crust surface, and pass it into Badlands. The outcome of this \"one way coupling\" is presented in Luke Hardiman Honours thesis."},

The subducting plate is 100km thick, 3,000kmwide and 7,000kmin length, and is built from 4 layers. The overriding plate has three domains: a back-arc region (1,200 km) a transitional region (350 km) and a continental backstop (750 km), each of which comprises two layers of equal thickness. The indenting ribbon is 50km in thickness, 1,500km wide and 500km deep (perpendicular to the convergence direction). Each of the vertical boundaries is a symmetry plane."},
