The model domain is 42 km long and 17.4 km wide, with a grid resolution of 80 m. From top to bottom the model contains an air-like layer, the sedimentary package, basement, and a rigid base that is used to implement our isostasy boundary condition. Prelimanary experiments were run to calibrate the mechanical stratigraphy for the New Guinea fold belt, and have arrived at the rheological parameters shown in the table below. The rheology for each layer is reflective of its competence relative to the entire multilayer.\nThe top wall of the model employs a free movement boundary condition. The bottom wall has free movement in the X direction and an isostasy boundary condition in the Y direction. On the right wall, we apply a variable boundary condition, pushing the basement by 0.7 cm/yr and the sedimentary stack at 2cm/yr. On the left wall we apply a variable boundary condition, where the rigid base block underlying the basement is evacuated out of the model at the same velocity as it enters from the right wall. This allows our rigid base to act as a conveyor belt. We apply a velocity gradient from the top of the rigid base to the bottom of the basement, over 500m, to ease the transition to a horizontally fixed boundary condition, employing the left wall to act as a backstop. A psuedo-isostatic boundary condition is employed at the base. The pressure at the base of the model is calculated and held constant through time, by updating the vertical velocity at the base of the model at each timestep. "},

(2016) with mantle flow experiments to model the evolving mantle structure for the post-Pangea timeframe. In addition to incorporating relative motion between plates, the tectonic reconstructions presented here use a hybrid absolute reference frame based on a moving hotspot model from Torsvik et al. (2008) from 0–70 Ma, and a true polar wander corrected paleomagnetic model from Steinberger & Torsvik (2008) for older times, allowing for a 35 Myr transition period (70–105 Ma) from one reference frame to the other (Muller et al., 2016). A key feature of these plate reconstructions is the algorithm that generates time-evolving and topologically-closed plate polygons (Gurnis et al., 2012). These global plate topologies were used to sample the plate velocity field, which was imposed on the surface of the global mantle flow experiments (Gurnis et al., 2012)."},

In this setting, lithospheric thinning can be extreme and localized, leading to very deep basins and thick accumulation of sediments. We hypothesise that the redistribution of surface load from source-to-sink modulates the stress field in the upper crust where faults and fractures initiate and control the architecture of sedimentary basins. In this suite of experiments, we compare the same experiment with and without surface processes, and we consider a variety of scenario varying sea-level (-200m, -500m, -800m with respect to the position of the surface of the crust), and the rheology of the lithosphere. The dimension of the model is 384x256x128 km. It includes 8 km of air-like material, 40 km of crust (upper crust is in blue, lower crust in orange), 60 km of lithospheric mantle (green), and 20 km of asthenosphere (blue). Two vertical and parallel master faults are embedded into the lithosphere in the form of two pre-damaged prism with dimension 192x25x95 km, extending from 5 km below the surface of the crust down to base of the lithosphere. The damage inside these prisms follows a gaussian with peak damage in the center of the prism along the X and Y axes. These two faults are non-overlapping. Their walls and tips are separated by a gap of 48 km and 0 km respectively (see Figure above). A kinematic boundary condition designed to promote transcurrent tectonics is imposed on the two vertical walls normal to the X direction. The velocity component along X is ±1.92 cm/yr (see Figure), and we impose a velocity component along Z of 0.025 cm/yr to prevent rivers to fall off the grid. A free slip condition is attached to the base of the model and to the two vertical walls parallel to the direction of motion. A pseudo-isostatic boundary condition is imposed at the base of the model. Models are run for 10 myr. We have run this experiment using three numerical framework: Underworld 1.8, Underworld Geodynamics, and Badlands-Underworld Geodynamics. The Underworld 1.8 outputs were used to extract the velocity field close to the crust surface, and pass it into Badlands. The outcome of this \"one way coupling\" is presented in Luke Hardiman Honours thesis."},

Here, the aim is to develop an Underworld 2D template capable of matching the modelling outcomes of the best sandbox experiments. Our template represents a domain 144 km long and 36 km deep, the top 12 km of which is made of air-like material. There is 16 km of sedimentary rocks (pre-rift sequence) distributed over 10 layers, the top 10 are 1.5 km thick. Underneath, there is 8 km of stronger rocks (i.e. larger cohesion and coefficient of friction). We include a salt-like layer (constant density 2000 kg/m3, viscosity 1e19 Pa.s), either at the surface of the model, or within top section of the pre-rift sequence. The density of the sediments increases with depth either incrementaly or following a dependence on the confining pressure to simulate compaction. During extension, the progressive burial of the salt layer under sediments of increasing density results in a density inversion. In some models we impose a pseudo-isostatic condition at the base of the model, to maintain the lithostatic pressure constant. The wall to the right moves away at 2 cm/yr. To mimic sandbox kinematic boundary conditions, we i/ turn off the isostasy, ii/ impose a constant velocity at the base of the model, as well as on the vertical wall on the left where it meets with the lower basal layer, and iii/ we add a thin, low viscosity layer, to decouple the sedimentary sequence from the backstop and the bottom layer."},
